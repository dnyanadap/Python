Python codes for biological data

Here are the codes that I have written for DNA and RNA analysis.
They include:
1. DNA translation and reverse complement generation
2. Calculation of GC percent and hydrophobicity scores
3. Generation of codons and nmers from a sequence
4. Biopython - Retrieving data from Genbank
